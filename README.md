Features
This project successfully implements all mandatory and optional hackathon requirements, resulting in a feature-rich and robust application.

üöÄ Advanced Features
AI-Powered Commands: Use natural language to perform actions. The custom-built AI parser translates queries like "ai create a folder named reports" into safe, executable commands.

Command History: Easily navigate through your previously used commands by pressing the Up and Down arrow keys.

Tab Auto-Completion: Increase your efficiency by typing the start of a command and pressing Tab to cycle through matches.

System Monitoring: Get a quick overview of system health with the sysinfo command, which displays real-time CPU and Memory usage.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Core commands like ls, cd, pwd, mkdir, and rm are handled internally with Python, ensuring they work flawlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Secure Execution: The backend is designed to be secure, using Python's libraries for file system operations to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

Responsive Interface: The UI is clean, modern, and fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on any device.

Robust Error Handling: The terminal provides clear and informative feedback for invalid commands or operational errors.

Tech Stack
